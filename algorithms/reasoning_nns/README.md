# Reasoning Neural Networks

Neural architectures with test-time compute and reasoning capabilities:
- Chain-of-Thought models (DeepSeek-R1 style)
- Multi-step reasoning architectures
- Test-time compute models
- Step-by-step inference systems

Specialized for complex reasoning tasks requiring deliberate thinking during inference.
